# ✅ Text Overlay Toggle Feature - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Added a toggle switch that allows users to choose between two text generation modes:

### 📝 Mode 1: Programmatic Text Overlay (Default - Recommended)
- **How it works**: AI generates a clean product image, then Spanish text is added programmatically using PIL
- **Advantages**: 
  - ✅ Perfect Spanish text with no errors
  - ✅ Professional typography and styling
  - ✅ Consistent formatting and layout
  - ✅ Guaranteed text quality
- **Best for**: Production use, professional ads, when text accuracy is critical

### 🤖 Mode 2: AI-Generated Text
- **How it works**: AI generates the complete ad image including all text directly
- **Advantages**: 
  - ✅ More creative freedom in text placement
  - ✅ Artistic text integration with the product
  - ✅ Potentially more creative layouts
- **Considerations**: 
  - ⚠️ May have Spanish text errors
  - ⚠️ Less consistent text quality
  - ⚠️ AI-generated text can be unpredictable
- **Best for**: Creative exploration, when artistic integration is more important than text perfection
