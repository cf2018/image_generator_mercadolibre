# Project Status Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED - Production Ready

This MercadoLibre Instagram Ad Generator is now **production-ready** with a robust, tested solution.

### Key Achievements

1. **âœ… Reliable Scraping Engine**
   - Migrated from Selenium to Playwright for better Docker compatibility
   - Handles MercadoLibre's dynamic content and anti-bot measures
   - Extracts: title, price, description, product images

2. **âœ… Perfect Ad Generation**
   - **Two-step approach** eliminates AI text generation errors
   - Step 1: Generate clean, text-free product images using minimal prompts
   - Step 2: Add professional Spanish ad text programmatically using PIL
   - Ensures 100% accurate Spanish text with no AI-generated errors

3. **âœ… Professional Image Quality**
   - Instagram-optimized 1080x1080 format
   - Professional typography with proper Spanish fonts
   - Gradient overlays for text readability
   - Price formatting and compelling CTAs
   - No unwanted AI-generated text artifacts

4. **âœ… Robust Technical Stack**
   - Updated to new `google-genai` SDK (latest)
   - Playwright for reliable, dockerizable scraping
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Docker-ready for production deployment

5. **âœ… Comprehensive Testing**
   - `test_flask_workflow.py` - Full end-to-end workflow validation
   - `test_text_free.py` - Validates AI generates text-free images
   - `minimal_test.py` - Basic Gemini API connectivity
   - Multiple component tests for isolated debugging

### Technical Innovation

The breakthrough was implementing a **two-step image generation approach**:

```
1. AI Image Generation (Minimal Prompt)
   â†“
   "Clean product image, no text, professional"
   â†“
   Text-free product image

2. Programmatic Text Overlay (PIL)
   â†“
   Spanish title + price + CTA + styling
   â†“
   Professional Instagram ad
```

This eliminates the core problem of AI-generated text errors while maintaining professional quality.
